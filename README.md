 <b>   Why our team is special? </b> <br>
The application is distinctive because it will serve as a link between the Palestinian 
community and the international community of IEEE, where it will work to introduce the outside world 
to the activities, events and achievements of the branch at the Arab and global level and will also contribute to
the interaction between the associate members and members from other Arab and foreign countries, which in turn will 
facilitate the participation of our team in their various activities of competitions And events, such as the presentation 
of papers in the event of conferences or participation in meetings aimed at promoting the parent organization.
